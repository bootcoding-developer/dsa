# Running sum of array elements

Given an integer array numbers, sum of all previous elements as running sum of an array


### Example 1
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```sh
Input: numbers = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]

```


```sh
//Example 2:
Input: numbers = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5] 
```

```sh

//Example 3:
Input: numbers = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]

``` 


### Write logic inside pre-defined method
```sh 
public int[] getRunningSum(int[] nums) {
    // Write logic here
}
```
